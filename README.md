# bpm-converter
Converts Beats per minute (BPM) to milliseconds.

This is useful when musicians want to achieve automated delay effects. A "valid" delay has a functional dependency to its beat.

The bpm-converter provides ms for quarter, eights, sixteenth and triplets, so the delay can be adjusted until the user is happy with it.
